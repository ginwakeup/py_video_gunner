# VideoGear 

This example uses VideoGear for video uploading.

To run it:

- Replace the connection IP in `server.py` and `client.py` with your IP.
  - I couldn't make this work with `localhost` for some reason. 
- Run `server.py`
- Run `client.py`
- `py_video_upload/Output.mp4` will be generated.
