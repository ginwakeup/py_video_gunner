# grpc_video_upload
This is an example on how to send video data through gRPC API and OpenCV.

It shouldn't be used in Production since solutions like Netgear do this
way better.

It is a good experiment to get along with gRPC Stream Channel.

## Contained Examples
- gRPC Stream request to single response for video upload.
- gRPC Stream request to Stream response for getting a status of the upload over time.
